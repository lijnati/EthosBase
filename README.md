# EthosBase

EthosBase built on Base Chain. Users accumulate reputation scores based on their behavior, which unlocks better rates, lower collateral requirements, and access to exclusive pools.

## Features

### Core Reputation System
- **Multi-dimensional scoring**: Tracks loan repayments, staking behavior, flash loan usage, and community contributions
- **Weighted scoring algorithm**: Different categories have different impacts on total score
- **Time decay mechanism**: Scores naturally decay over time to encourage continued good behavior
- **Tier-based classification**: Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum tiers

### Access Control Benefits
- **Dynamic loan terms**: Better reputation = lower collateral requirements and interest rates
- **Increased loan limits**: Higher tiers can borrow larger amounts
- **Exclusive pool access**: Premium users get access to special lending pools
- **Interest rate discounts**: Up to 2% discount for Platinum tier users

### React Frontend
- **Minimal Base design**: Clean UI with Base's color scheme and Inter font
- **Real-time data**: Live blockchain data updates
- **Wallet integration**: Seamless MetaMask connection
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile

### Reputation Categories

| Category | Weight | Actions Tracked |
|----------|--------|----------------|
| Loan Repayment | 40% | On-time repayments, defaults |
| Staking | 25% | Staking rewards, early unstaking |
| Community | 20% | Governance participation, contributions |
| Flash Loans | 15% | Proper usage vs abuse |

<!-- ## 🔧 Integration Guide

### For DeFi Protocols

1. **Deploy the reputation system**:
```solidity
ReputationSystem reputation = new ReputationSystem();
ReputationGatedAccess access = new ReputationGatedAccess(address(reputation));
```

2. **Authorize your protocol as a scorer**:
```solidity
reputation.authorizeScorer(address(yourProtocol));
```

3. **Update reputation based on user actions**:
```solidity
reputation.updateReputation(
    user,
    ReputationSystem.ActionType.LOAN_REPAYMENT,
    50, // positive score change
    "On-time loan repayment"
);
```

4. **Check user access levels**:
```solidity
(string memory tier, uint256 maxLoan, uint256 collateralRatio, , ) = 
    access.getUserAccessLevel(user);
```

### Reputation Actions & Score Changes

| Action | Score Change | Description |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
