## Features

### Core Reputation System

<!-- ## üîß Integration Guide

### For DeFi Protocols

1. **Deploy the reputation system**:
```solidity
ReputationSystem reputation = new ReputationSystem();
ReputationGatedAccess access = new ReputationGatedAccess(address(reputation));
```

2. **Authorize your protocol as a scorer**:
```solidity
reputation.authorizeScorer(address(yourProtocol));
```

3. **Update reputation based on user actions**:
```solidity
reputation.updateReputation(
    user,
    ReputationSystem.ActionType.LOAN_REPAYMENT,
    50, // positive score change
    "On-time loan repayment"
);
```

4. **Check user access levels**:
```solidity
(string memory tier, uint256 maxLoan, uint256 collateralRatio, , ) = 
    access.getUserAccessLevel(user);
```
